Few examples of anti-patterns in JavaScript are the following:

   Polluting the global namespace by defining a large number of variables in the global context
Passing strings rather than functions to either setTimeout or setInterval as this triggers the use of eval() internally.
   Modifying the Object class prototype (this is a particularly bad anti-pattern)
