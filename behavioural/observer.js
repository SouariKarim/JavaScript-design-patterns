// The Observer is a behavioral JS design pattern that lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects (observers) about any events that happen to the object (subject) theyâ€™re observing.

// it is like there is a subject and there are many observers waiting for a notification coming from the subject when an event fires on that subject
